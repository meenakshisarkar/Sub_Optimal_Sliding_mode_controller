# Sub_Optimal_Sliding_mode_controller
This project was part of my Masters thesis. Objective was the design and development of  a novel hybrid Sub-Optimal Sliding Mode Controller (SOSMC) for energy efficient navigation of autonomous mobile vehicles in unstructured environment. Up to 25\% improved efficiency in control effort was noted in the simulated environment for an autonomous underwater vehicle surveying on a 3D helical path.
The project was selected for Gandhian Young Techonological Innovation Award 2015 and INAE best M.Tech Thesis award 2015.
